# ChatBox

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.
This a simple MEAN Project. Created this to explore how socket, node and angular 4 works.
The backend logic is not complete here, it's maily a static app. Will try to complete it though.
Authentification is also done.
If you want to just learn how to set up a basic MEAN project and how socket works. Then it will be helpful.

## Run the application
Run `npm install ` and then `ng build && node ./bin/www`, 

use this if `ng` gives error before using ng command -> ` alias ng="./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng" `
